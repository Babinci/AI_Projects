# AI_Projects

Repository for projects using AI models for various tasks locally.

This repository contains several projects leveraging AI models for audio, video, and language processing. The projects are organized into the following categories:

-   **Core Backend:** A Django project providing a backend for remote generation and processing tasks, such as video processing and image generation.
-   **Audio Projects:** Projects focused on audio processing tasks, such as denoising and dereverberation.
-   **LLM Projects:** Projects utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks, such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and AI specialists.
-   **Visual Projects:** Projects focused on video and image processing tasks, such as greenscreening, denoising, and super-resolution.

## Current State

-   Topics generator for freestyle app (RAG + Ollama Polish Bielik model)
-   Video greenscreening model

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

-   **Core Backend:** Contains the Django project for backend services.
-   **Audio Projects:** Includes projects related to audio processing.
-   **LLM Projects:** Contains projects focused on Large Language Models.
-   **Visual Projects:** Includes projects for video and image processing.
-   **memory-bank:** Stores project documentation and context.
